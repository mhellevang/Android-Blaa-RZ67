# Android-Blaa-RZ67
An android app for controlling the RZ67-ttgo-esp32-trigger 

This is an Android app made to controll the [RZ67 ESP32 Trigger](https://github.com/mhellevang/RZ67-esp32-trigger). 

The sole intent of the project is to enable remote triggering (direct and countdown) of the Mamiya RZ67 analog camera using Bluetooth and a simple ESP32 controlled device.
