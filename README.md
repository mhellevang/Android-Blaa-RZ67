# openrz67-android
This is an Android app for controlling the [openrz67-trigger](https://github.com/mhellevang/openrz67-trigger) bluetooth remote trigger for the Mamiya RZ67 camera.

The sole intent of the project is to enable remote triggering (direct and countdown) of the Mamiya RZ67 analog camera using Bluetooth and a simple ESP32 controlled device.

## Status:
The app is currently in a very early stage of development. It works as intended and enables the remote triggering of the camera. 
However, there are still some issues that need to be resolved. It's not super stable and can crash at times, but it's usable.

Pull requests welcome.

## Features:
- Automatically connect to theopenrz67-trigger device
- Trigger the camera using the shutter button
- Trigger a delayed trigger with a 10 seconds countdown

## Installation:
I've yet to realse the app anywhere, so the only way to get it running is to build it yourself.
